# `@dataflor-ag/df-ui-drawer`

> Skeleton components for the drawer component
> Drawers allow for more content to be available to the user without taking up extra space on the screen. They behave similar to a modal, but with the added benefit of taking up less prominent screen real estate and are easier to scroll for longer content requirements.

## Usage

```
import { DrawerHeader, DrawerBody, DrawerFooter } from "@dataflor-ag/df-ui-drawer";
```
