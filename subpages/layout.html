                The use of a 12-column layout is a common practice in frontend design due to its flexibility and ease of use. It provides a standard grid system 
                that allows designers and developers to create consistent and visually appealing layouts for websites and applications. By breaking the screen into 12 equal parts, 
                designers can easily allocate space to different <a href="#GlossaryComponent">components</a> and adjust their layout accordingly. This grid system also allows for responsive design, 
                where the layout adjusts to different screen sizes, making it an ideal choice for modern web development. Additionally, using a 12-column layout ensures 
                that the design is easily maintainable, as changes can be made quickly and efficiently due to the predictable grid structure. Overall, the use of a 12-column layout 
                is a practical and effective solution for creating high-quality, responsive frontend designs.

                We are defining our column layout with fixed gaps between each column, but witha dynamic column width. 
                This ensures that we fill every screen completely and makes the layout look natural and dynamic.
            </p>
            <p id='styleguidelabel'>
                An important part of this layout are media-queries. Those media-queries define certain <a href="suppages/glossary.html#breakpoints">breakpoints</a> which causes 
                the grid to rearange and shrink itself down so it fits the screensize of the device.
                Those breakpoints are defined by us developers. They should cover most common screensizes used by our users.

            <h4>Rules</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Components have a minimum size of two columns</li>
                <li>Components rearange with changing grid layout</li>
                <li>Grid only contain components</li>
                <li>Components do not contain other components</li>
                <li>Components need to have an ID which defines the needed width as columns</li>
                
                <pre>
#ContactList {
    grid-column-end: span 8;
}
                </pre>
                <li>The gap between each column/row has a fixed width of 30 pixel</li>
            </ul>              
            <pre>
